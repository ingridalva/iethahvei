                            <p>Richard Allan Peterson (September 12, 1946 – October 12, 2009) known as Dickie Peterson was an American musician, best known as the bassist and lead singer for Blue Cheer. The descriptor "stoner rock" may originate from the title of the 1997 Roadrunner Records compilation Burn One Up! Music for Stoners.Desert rock is also used interchangeably as a descriptor, and was coined by a MeteorCity Records intern, around the time the label released the 1998 stoner rock compilation Welcome to MeteorCity.

EDIT: I've gotten alot of requests so I'll update listi. I was given a large vinyl collection by my in-laws. I’ve taken what I wanted to keep and am now sharing the wealth. A lot of the sleeves aren’t in the best shape but most of the vinyl looks amazing. Some sleeves have names written on them. For those, regardless of condition, I’ve rated them no higher than VG. All prices are negotiable and I’m willing to listen to whatever offers you might want to put out there. I honestly haven't researched value/worth so my prices could be off. Shipping 
Hey dudes I've listed this stuff before but there is some new stuff sprinkled in here on the list. Prices are pretty damn reasonable ( at least last time I price checked them) amp#x200B; All records ship free in the US in a proper record mailer,stored outside the jacket to prevent seam splits. The only thing i'm looking to trade for is 90's hip hop/rap and some newer ( pretty much anything that sounds 90's so no auto tune shit). amp#x200B; ## re-post of an old set sale with new reduced prices.

I'm an amateur with data analysis so my methods aren't perfect (more info and the full lists here ( but I figured I'd share what I found! Let me know if you've got any other thoughts or uses for the dataset! Edit: I've redone the top albums list to remove albums that received more than 50% of their. Don't get me wrong; Black Sabbath was an AMAZING band and their debut was phenomenal, but the term "heavy metal" should go back farther than 1970. Personally I think the album that created heavy metal as we know it is Blue Cheer's Vincebus Eruptum. No matter how terrible the production is, that album is heavy as balls, and the songs were played live that way too. It's a shame that bands like Blue Cheer, Iron Butterfly, and Budgie—ESPECIALLY Budgie—have not gotten nearly as much recognition

We usually couldn't authenticate them so we usually told the seller that we couldn't give them any extra so they may just want to keep it, almost every time they would still want to trade them in. In addition, I would go to instore signings and we would often get tons of signed CD booklets of new releases to give away which Hey, this seems to be a trend, but I am at a crisis for some bill money and need to make some money relatively quick.
