Hi, my PC keeps shutting down with no warning and no BSOD. Reliability History (https://i.imgur.com/tJlnwj2.png) amp#x200B; The problem details for the crashes in reliability history are simply. gtThe previous system shutdown at 11:13:01 on ‎13/‎11/‎2018 was unexpected. amp#x200B; amp#x200B; When it then tries to boot it flashes the ASUS screen for a split second then resets itself and does the same again on a loop. amp#x200B; After waiting a short while i try again Greetings everyone! First, I'm really new to the hardware world but I hope I can explain myself correctly. Yesterday, I bought an MSI GTX1060 6GB Gaming X in order to upgrade my previous graphics card (GTX 770). I mounted it myself (it was incredibly easy for a first time) and decided to try it out with some Overwatch. The game started pretty smooth: 70 fps on ultra quality. But after a couple of minutes, I started to get some freezes and fps drops to 20-30. I tried reducing the graphics.

Guys i really need your help because I'm kinda going crazy. Yesterday i've upgraded my old computer with an Nvidia GeForce GTX 1070 , since then i can't play the game with more than 20-30 FPS with huge stuttering.

Hello everyone, this is my first time posting on the subreddit, hoping to find some help after hours of searching on google and finding nothing. BTW, I live in Toronto, Canada if that matters. My PC specs are: WINDOWS 10 Asus H87 PLus motherboard i5 4570 8gb Ram evga gtx 760 evga 500 watt psu 1tb seagate hdd 1tb wd hdd So my issue is that instead of getting 50mbps download and 10 mbps upload, I'm only getting 5mbps download ONLY ON my PC. However I'm getting 10mbps upload speed, which. I've been having some trouble this week with my desktop and just wanted a second view of the problem incase I'm missing something. Thursday I began to experience some BSOD with fltmgr.sys crashing, issue happened a couple of times before I disconnected two SATA HDD that had failed a SMART Test, this seemed to stop that issue. Yesterday I came home to find the LAN Network adapter wasn't picking up a cable was inserted, reinstallation of the driver had no effect and the activity lights. So I never really had an issue with my computer till about 2 days ago when the video signal was randomly lost and the USB ports stopped functioning halfway through a video. All these happened while the computer was still running and everything seems fine in there. The only way to get it back running again would be to hard reset it and even then the problem will just surface at random points in time, particularly as soon as windows boots up. Booting into safe mode seems to not surface the issue.

I am running on windows 7. My motherboard is a ASUS H87-PLUS LGA 1150 Intel H87 HDMI SATA 6Gb/s U. I have most of the USB ports filled because I have a keyboard that uses 2 of the ports, a mouse, and headphones that also plug in 2 times because they are wireless. The mouse and keyboard are razer products. All of my drivers are up to date, so I have no idea where to even start. Thanks guys. Here is a link to my build: http://pcpartpicker.com/p/Gx9mLk. I did a Windows 10 update yesterday and everything was great until I rebooted my computer. On reboot, my Nvidia GTX 780 is getting code 43. I spent all last night and this morning trying to fix it and no solutions I've found have worked. Hoping someone here may have a new idea. I am not a professional, just a pretty tech literate person, and the computer is one I built myself a couple of years ago.

So I just finished building last night, but I was too tired to finish after windows 8.1 loaded. I have an ASUS H87 Plus mobo and GTX 760. I went to the ASUS site ( and when I looked at the mobo drivers there were so many. Do I just download every single one and is there any order in which I should download them? Edit: Link to the drivers Im looking I just built my computer and installed windows 8.1. I have an ASUS H87 Plus mobo and I went to download drivers from the ASUS site, but some are more than 6 months old. How do I know which ones I will need for my computer? Are there any programs available that will check my computer for me? I heard windows will download some drivers to make it compatible. Edit: Wow thanks for the quick response.

Okay so I have had my custom made p.c since about July of last year, I did not have a SSD installed on it and used a HDD. However last week I decided to upgrade it. anyway I deleted all my info off of the HDD and disconnected the HDD and installed my operating system on the SSD. However once I install the operating it goes to my desktop and works fine. Once I install my mobo drivers and restart the system for them first time it just gives me blue screens. If i reinstall the operating system.
