I'm trying to figure out how to assign a knob in the Beatstep to the Cuttoff knob (for instance) in Arturia's Mini V instrument. I don't know if I should be assigning the Beatstep's knob in:Arturia's Midi Control Center/Device Settings/Controller Map/MIDI CC Or I should do it in Mini V knob/ Midi Control Setup In any case, I really know how to do it. Any hints? Thanks.  Arturia MiniBrute 2 Semi-Modular Analog Synthesizer Gear4music overview - Duration: 5 minutes, 58 seconds.

I'm talking about the Arturia edition. Despite it's simple lay-out (good thing) it is able to pump out really cool/unique stuff (cool harmonics/timbres). This is due to the modulation/complex OSC's. Are there any other VST's that I'm not aware of that are in the same league. I've posted this as a bug but I'm not sure it actually is since I have a feeling I might be the only one with this problem. I use Arturia's VSTs (e.g. the DX7 VST) and ever since Ableton Live 10 came out, they are now ugly / low res. Is it just me or does everyone have this problem? I'm using Windows 10 on a Surface Pro 2017. edit: Note that when I open it from outside Ableton through the shortcut, it looks great. It's only when I open it from inside it goes all ugly. So I'm guessing I've been playing around with the demo of Arturia Collection 5 and really like the sounds, unfortunately there's about a 70% chance it will crash my DAW within 5 minutes of using any of the synths (none of my other synths or plugins do this!) So I'm wondering if anyone has any good alternatives to the Jupiter, the Prophet, and the Moog Modular that I could try? I'm not willing to drop £400 on the collection if it's not going to be stable. 
i know this sub is more about hardware synths, but im still hoping someone could help me.i recently got an arturia minilab and i want to use it with other arturia vsts, particularly their minimoog vsts, the keys work fine, automation and stuff works great, but i cant figure out for the life of me how to get the physical knobs to move the parameters inside of the synth, anyone figured it out yet? i use fl studio. Hi all, i've a question for you :) i got an ipad with geo shred control installed and i'm trying to connect it to my laptop (win10). i would like to use my ipad as a midi controller to play with my arturia vsts. I tried to connect the ipad using the ipad camera kit and a usb cable to my laptop, but my laptop can't see my ipad as a midi device. what am I doing wrong? is there someone that can help me? amp#x200B; Thanks in advance. amp#x200B;. Occasionally, and seamingly completely randomly, when using VSTs such as Waldorf PPG or any of Arturia's VSTs, when the MIDI for a VST track is being played back, the VST audio will distort badly, and the distortion jumps to maximum volume the instant it happens. Restarting Cubase doesn't fix the issue. I have to leave it for a few minutes before reloading Cubase to fix it. The glitching is extremely loud, way beyond safety limits. It only seems to be certain VST patches that it happens 
I bought the Arturia VST collection mainly for the Synclavier and the CMI but now I’m obsessing over the Matrix 12. Does anyone have a fave from this collection. Alright, so I know its not strictly relevant to synths, but I plan on using the keylab 88 to control vst synths. I'm looking to buy my first "nice" midi controller. I've never spent money on gear aside from a 25 key mini controller. I want to buy myself something nice. Something to play my vst instruments on that doesn't feel like i'm doing 'data' input. So here are the reasons why I'm considering buying one: 1) It works well with arturia's vst synths. 2) It has a fatar piano-like keybed. I was really intrigued by the new Arturia Buchla VST, but people keep complaining that Arturias VSTs don't sound right. I think they sound pretty great, but are there any other good west coast VSTs with a good interface around? What about hardware, is it always just extremely expensive inb4: I already browsed the official IL forum as well as the arturia site and followed all steps to no avail. Also some of the instructions were not clear enough and/or confusing. That is why I came here I recently bought said MIDI controller. After lots of troubles I managed to connect it to FL Studio and play some of my VSTs with it. However I can't seem to get the DAW Command and the Transport buttons running. I would also like to switch between presets (using the next and previous buttons). Hi, I was wondering if there's a way to code musical patterns like sonic pi but using FL Studio to play them. It would be nice to create loops for drones but using the sounds of arturia vst for example Thank. Hi all, I'm starting to get into music again and I've always loved Reason. I use version 8 I think? No VST support, so it might be worth it just for that but what do you guys think about the sound? like huge improvement? I also use Ableton and Pro tools and in the old days I would export reason stems to Pro tools, is that still necessary ? or is it possible to create professional grade mixes in Reason 10? Thanks. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQStbwNCl2Y (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQStbwNCl2Y) amp#x200B; what type of synthesis So yep, I'm trying to make some eighties horror soundtrack kind of shit, and DSI OB6 seems perfect for that. Problem is, I can't afford it right now. Is there a VST with this kind of sound. 
I have Serum amp Komplete. I don’t really feel like I’m in desperate need of new synths. But someone is selling V Collection for 0 and that just seems like a steal to me.
